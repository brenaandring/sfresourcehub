      <p>SF Resource Hub is a project that raises awareness and gathers resources in one centralized location
        for those most in need. According to Wikipedia, the San Francisco Bay Area comprises nine northern California
        counties
        and contains four of the ten most expensive counties in the United States, Strong economic growth has created
        hundreds
        of thousands of new jobs, but coupled with severe restrictions on building new housing units, it has resulted in
        an extreme
        housing shortage which has driven rents to extremely high levels. From 2015 to 2017, the homeless population had
        increased
        by 15%.
      </p>
      <p>San Francisco has several thousand homeless, despite extensive efforts by city government to address the issue.
        The dramatically larger prevalence of visible homelessness in the city (relative to other large US cities) is
        widely
        noted by visitors as well as residents, and as of 2018, is starting to impact the city's largest industry, tourism
        (a $9 billion industry).
      </p>
      <p>The number of the people in poverty in the San Francisco Bay Area grew from 573,333 (8.6%) in 2000 to 668,876
        (9.7%)
        in 2006-2010.[8] While poverty rates vary greatly across the SF Bay area, in 2015, the Silicon Valley Institute
        for
        Regional Studies published that the poverty rate was 11.3%, having a slight downward trend from 12%; however, it
        was
        still above the historical average rate of 9%.
      </p>
      <p>As a way to help combat the housing crisis, SF Resource Hub was created to help individuals in need to get the
        most
        accurate and up-to-date information on events and provide them with free sources around the city. We partnered
        with
        non-profit organizations in San Francisco to to raise awareness
